# STAR

A work in progress implementation of the [STAR biodiversity metric by Muir et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01432-0). Currently only does the initial AoH stages.

See [method.md](method.md) for a description of the methodology, or `scripts/run.sh` for how to execute the pipeline.
